# TODO

Organized as milestones. Each one should leave the workspace building and runnable.

## Direction

VN_Rust is a Ren'Py alternative for **Rust developers**: writers work in `.story` files,
while all logic, state and UI live in Rust and can be debugged with normal Rust tooling.

A new game should get going with: `cargo new` → add `vn_engine` → a short `main.rs` that
registers characters/variables/commands → drop `.story` files in `assets/` → `cargo run`.

Three levels of control, each optional:

1. **Defaults**: write stories, register variables, done.
2. **Override pieces**: replace the main menu, dialogue box, choice screen, etc. via traits; hooks.
3. **Bring your own frontend**: use `vn_script` alone and drive the VM, which emits events.

### Workspace layout

| Crate | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `crates/vn_script` | DSL lexer, parser, compiler, VM. **No rendering deps**, reusable by CLI/LSP |
| `crates/vn_engine` | raylib engine: screens, resources, game loop. Re-exports `raylib` and `vn_script` (as `script`) |
| `crates/vn_cli` | `vn` binary. Currently `vn dump <file>`; later `check`, `new`, `run` |
| `examples/god_is_watching` | The reference game, and the first real consumer of the engine API |

## M0: Reorganization

- [x] Split `vn_core` into `vn_script` (no raylib) and `vn_engine`
- [x] Move the game out of `runtime/` into `examples/god_is_watching`
- [x] `test_compiler` → `vn_cli` (`vn dump <file>`, no hardcoded path)
- [x] Rename `StoryProvider` → `StoryVm`
- [x] Drop the legacy JSON story types (`runtime/types/story.rs`) and unused deps
- [x] Shared `[workspace.package]` / `[workspace.dependencies]`

## M1: Example game setup

- [x] Commit an assets layout for the example: `examples/god_is_watching/assets/{story,characters,backgrounds}`. `.gitignore` now ignores only the root `/assets/`.
- [x] Story adapted from the source documents: `01_mary`, `02_moriarty`, `03_field_post` (one POV each)
- [x] Sample story covering every DSL feature: `crates/vn_script/tests/fixtures/all_features.story` (lexer, parser and VM tests)
- [x] Placeholder character art: generated, color-coded, labeled fallback texture in `ResourceManager`
- [x] Fix: the engine passed the script **path** to `StoryVm::from_source`. Added `StoryVm::from_file`.
- [x] Resolve asset paths relative to the game crate (`ResourceManager` has an asset root; the example passes `CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR/assets`)
- [x] README: how to run the example

## M2: VM as an event stream

- [x] Design the VM API: `advance() -> Event` (`Say`, `Choice`, `Show`, `Hide`, `Clear`, `Call`, `End`), `choose(i)`, plus a read-only view of state (active characters, variables)
- [x] Screens render from events/state, not `instructions[ip]` (`playing_screen.rs`)
- [x] Remove the `Say` + `Pause` double-block (was two clicks per line, with a blank dialogue box on the second)
- [x] VM auto-starts: leading `show`s run before the first line is displayed.
- [x] Compile the whole file into one program with a scene table (absolute jump targets).
- [x] Implement `Jump { scene_id }`
- [x] Choices: `choose(index)`, plus rendering and click handling in the example
- [x] Parser: `set`, `add` (`+=`/`-=`). `remove`/`clear` done in M1.
- [x] Parse real conditions (`<var> <op> <literal>`, `&&`, `||`) into a `Condition` tree evaluated by the VM
- [x] String values (`"..."`) alongside enums, in `set` and conditions (tokenized condition parser)
- [x] `{variable}` interpolation in dialogue, narration, choices and the speaker (`{player_name} "..."`)
- [x] Compile `call` (emitted as `Event::Call`; no command registry yet)
- [x] `advance()` is a loop (was recursive `step()`), with a guard against jump loops that never produce an event.
- [x] New Game after returning to the menu reuses the old VM state. Add a reset.

## M3: App builder and registries (the "how do I get going" API) ← next

- [x] `VnApp` builder in `vn_engine`: title, window size, assets, story directory and entry scene, fonts, `.run()`
- [x] Character registry (id → display name, color, image set); display names may use `{variable}`
- [x] Text input screen (`ctx.ask_text`), used by the example's `ask_name` command
- [x] Variable registry (id → typed default: bool, int, enum, string)
- [x] Command registry (`.command(name, handler)`)
- [x] Typed command args (`|ctx, (item, count): (String, Option<u32>)|`)
- [x] Validation against the registries at startup, with file:line diagnostics (`AppError::Script`)
- [x] Game state by type (`.state(T)`, `ctx.state.get_mut::<T>()`), reset on New Game
- [x] Overlays (`.overlay(name, ..)`, `Action::overlay`) and HUD buttons on the playing screen
- [x] Returning to the playing screen shows the same line (`StoryVm::current()`)
- [x] Default screens shipped by the engine (start, main menu, playing), configured through the builder (`start_screen`, `main_menu`, `playing`); the game overrides them per `ScreenState` with `.screen()`
- [x] Pause menu overlay on Esc (Resume, Save, Load, Quick Save, Quick Load, Main Menu, Quit) with Save/Load as overlays, an overlay stack, and engine-level notifications
- [x] Confirmation dialogs (`Action::confirm`): pause → Main Menu / Quit, overwriting a save, loading during play
- [x] Rollback (wheel / Page Up-Down) with barriers: `commit`, `choice final:`, `through_choices`, blocked commands
- [ ] Rollback history in save files (rolling back after a load)
- [x] Confirm on the window close button during a game (raylib reports it for one frame; `request_close`)
- [x] Default settings screen (display, text speed; screen from the main menu, overlay from the pause menu), saved to `settings.json`
- [x] Engine-provided UI helpers (`ui::draw_button`, text, layout, backgrounds) and styles (`TextStyle`, `ButtonStyle`, `DialogueBoxStyle`)
- [ ] Hooks: `on_scene_enter`, etc.
- [ ] Hot reload of `.story` files in debug builds
- [x] `ScreenState` is now `StartScreen`, `MainMenu`, `Playing`, `Save`, `Load`, `TextInput`, `Settings`, `Custom(String)`, `Quit`

## M4: Validation and diagnostics

- [x] Replace `panic!`/`unwrap` in lexer/parser with `Diagnostic`s, with recovery so one broken line doesn't hide the rest (`compile_source`)
- [x] Validate against registries: characters/images, variables and types, command arity and types (M3)
- [x] Choice options non-empty (text and body), `choice:` has at least one option
- [x] Identifiers match `[a-z_][a-z0-9_]*` everywhere (scenes, characters, images, commands, variables, enum members); tabs in indentation are errors
- [x] `{variable}` in text must name a registered variable
- [x] Export the registry as a schema file (`schema.json`, refreshed in debug builds, `--export-schema`) so `vn check` and the LSP can validate without running the game
- [x] `vn check <path>`: whole story or one file in its project, schema found by walking up, exit code for CI
- [x] Parser edge cases:
  - [x] narration ending in `:` is lexed as `ChoiceOption` and panics
  - [x] an empty `if`/`else`/option body swallows the following siblings
  - [x] a stray `else:` or choice option outside its block panics
  - [x] `show` with a missing image id panics
  - [x] no string escaping: `\"` and `\\` (SCRIPT.md 3.7)
  - [x] a keyword-named character (`show "hi"`): keywords are reserved (SCRIPT.md 6.1)
- [x] `JumpIfFalse` handles only Int/Int and Bool/Bool, and ignores `op` for bools (now Int/Bool/Enum; ordering on bools/enums is a parse error)
- [x] `Add` on an unknown variable silently creates `Int(0)` (an error once variables are registered)
- [x] `ResourceManager::get_or_load` panics on a missing texture. Use a placeholder and log a warning. (M1)

## M5: Presentation

- [ ] Character positions: the default playing screen spreads characters evenly; add DSL positions (`show mary happy at left`)
- [ ] Backgrounds (needs DSL syntax)
- [x] Fonts: built-in Noto Sans default, per-role fonts (`FontRole`) loaded from `assets/fonts/`
- [x] Text wrapping (`Fonts::wrap`, `ui::draw_text_wrapped`)
- [x] Typewriter effect (text speed setting; click shows the whole line)
- [x] Window-relative layout in the default screens
- [x] Settings screen (see M3); volume settings come with audio
- [x] Clean exit (`ScreenState::Quit`)
- [ ] Audio: music and SFX (needs DSL syntax)

## M6: Save/load and tooling (save/load started early)

- [x] Save/load: VM snapshot (scene + offset + scene fingerprint, variables, characters, current line), game state by type name, JSON slots with atomic writes, all-or-nothing loads, `SaveError` / `LoadWarning`, default Save/Load screens, quick save/load
- [ ] Autosave (on scene change / on quit), save thumbnails, delete-slot and overwrite confirmation in the default screens
- [ ] Platform save directory (e.g. `~/.local/share/<game>`) instead of `./saves`
- [ ] Save format migrations when `SAVE_FORMAT_VERSION` changes
- [ ] `vn new` project template
- [x] Multi-file projects: every `.story` under `story_dir` is one program; diagnostics name their file; the example's chapters jump into each other
- [ ] Editor support for `.story` files:
  - [ ] `tree-sitter-story` grammar, with an external scanner for indentation (INDENT/DEDENT, like tree-sitter-python); corpus tests from `all_features.story`
  - [ ] Neovim: filetype detection, `highlights.scm`, `folds.scm`, `indents.scm` (registered through nvim-treesitter). Zed and Helix reuse the same grammar and queries
  - [ ] VS Code: a TextMate grammar for highlighting (VS Code doesn't highlight with tree-sitter), packaged as an extension
  - [ ] LSP (`vn lsp`, reusing `vn_script` diagnostics and the exported schema): errors as you type, go to scene definition, completion of scene/character/variable ids. Works in every editor
  - [ ] Formatter (`vn fmt`)

## Ongoing

- [ ] Tests: golden tests over the SCRIPT.md examples (lexer, parser and VM done in `crates/vn_script/tests/`)
- [x] SCRIPT.md §8.3 typo: `-+` → `-=`
- [ ] SCRIPT.md: specify backgrounds, audio, positions (string escaping done)
